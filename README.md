# Module-3-Project

Welcome to our Weather App!

Our fully API-integrated weather app is finally ready to see the world! 

Designed by Binh Tran and Ryan Kenyon, this website takes a zip code input from the user and displays current and upcoming weather information for their area.
Built through Bootstrap, our website uses data from api.openweathermap.org and Firebase to create a brilliant and simple user experience.
With only a five digit zip code, our website is designed to:
-Return the city name that the zip code correlates to, along with the current day and date.
-Display the current day's weather conditions, including chance of rain, humidity and current temperatures, and even a cute icon.
-Provide a seven day forecast from the current day with low and high temps respectively.
-Switch the current day to a forecasted day by clicking on of the seven days in the forecast section.
-Return an error message upon input of invalid zip codes.

We are very proud of what we have built and we hope our website can serve you well!
